# ðŸ”¨ Building from source

## Preparation

Make sure these packages are local:

- Visual Studio 2022 and Windows SDK.
- UWP Development Kit
- Source code for this project

## Add app credentials

This application uses a method called Oauth, so you must independently get a client ID and secret in your account.

<InfoBar
    severity="caution"
    title="Warning"
    message="Since this method is cumbersome for an open source app, we plan to remove this process in the future by exposing our own API, which is currently private."
/>

##### 1.  Create an [OAuth app](https://github.com/settings/developers/new):

##### 2.  Create a file named `AppCredentials.config` in the root of your FluentHub repo with the VS Solution Explorer.

##### 3.  Set the `id` and `secret` value as that of your app.

```xml
		<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
		<configuration>
		    <client>
		        <type key="id" value="YOUR-APP-ID"/>
		        <type key="secret" value="YOUR-APP-SECRET"/>
		    </client>
		</configuration>
```

##### 4. Set the startup project to "FluentHub" rather than "FluentHub.Octokit".

##### 5. Run in Debug.
