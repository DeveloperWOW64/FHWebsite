A project I've been working on - Solstice. It's an amazing video platform built in fluent-svelte, based on Codrex. It's still a work-in-progress, of course, but it will be fantastical at launch.

Of course, it still needs developers: the preview is hosted via Vercel [here](https://watch.codrex.dev). 
As well as this, you can submit PRs and issues [here](https://github.com/Fluxduct/Solstice).
